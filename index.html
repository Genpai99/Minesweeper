        <h1>Mission Summary: "Shadows of Neon"</h1>
        <h2>In Nightcity, Edgerunners who follow the orders of David Martinez, infiltrate OmniCorp's headquarters. Their goal: to hack the heavily guarded mainframe and expose corporate secrets. Kiwi, the team's skilled netrunner, must bypass the corporations security system, and breach the mainframe. Time is tight as guards close in.</h2>
        <h3>How to hack into the mainframe:
          1. Once you select start, a table of cells will appear.
          2. Click each cell until all cells have been revealed.
          3. Beware! Some cells contain circuit breakers that will fry the mainframe if revealed.
          4. Empty cells will contain numerical values that tell how many breakers are in cells immediately next to it.
        </h3>
